# Simple Arch Installer

This script allows you to install Arch Linux (UEFI) easily and quickly without any bloat.

This program is not intended for a beginner, it just allows you to automate the installation.

## How it works

The script will create 3 partitions:  
1: BOOT -> 550M  
2: SWAP -> 8G  
3: HOME -> _  
Then it will install the necessary packages

## Run the script

You have to clone the install.sh and launch it.

## Configure the script

The variables at the top of the page can be changed.

## Adding features

I advise you to follow the method of [suckless.org](https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/patches_in_git/) to patch your script
